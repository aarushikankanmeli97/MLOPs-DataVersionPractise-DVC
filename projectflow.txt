1. Create a git repo and clone it in local
2. Create main.py and add code to it. (it will save a csv file to "data" folder)
Do a git add-commit-push before initializing dvc
#pip install dvc
Now type "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
Create a dummy S3 folder 
We need to direct dvc to s3 hence "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
Next "dvc add data/"
    An Error pops up asking to execute these two commands ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
    Because initially we were tracking data/ folder fromm git so now we remove it for DVC to handle
Again execute "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then execute "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
Now execute "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data
Now make changes to main.py to append new row in data, check changes via "dvc status"
Again "dvc commit" and "dvc push"
