1. Create a git repo and clone it in local
2. Create main.py and add code to it. (it will save a csv file to "data" folder)
3. Do a git add-commit-push before initializing dvc
#pip install dvc
4. Now type "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
5. Create a dummy S3 folder 
6. We need to direct dvc to s3 hence "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
7. Next "dvc add data/"
    An Error pops up asking to execute these two commands ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
    Because initially we were tracking data/ folder fromm git so now we remove it for DVC to handle
8. Again execute "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then execute "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
9. Now execute "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
10. Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data
11. Now make changes to main.py to append new row in data, check changes via "dvc status"
12. Again "dvc commit" and "dvc push"
13. Then git add-commit-push (we're saving V2 of our data at this point)
14. Check dvc/git status, everything should be upto DataFrame
15. Now repeat step 10-12 for v3 data


git log --oneline
git checkout <hash> in order to roll to a particular version of data 
git checkout main in order to roll back to the latest version of data
dvc pull
